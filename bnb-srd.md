**Breath & Blood** is an adventure game for one facilitator (the **Overseer**) and (usually) at least one other player.
Players act as skilled and capable explorers and adventurers, making a hard living in a world littered with lost magic and decaying ruins.

## Overview

**Breath & Blood** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

### Neutrality
The Overseer's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

### Classless Progression
A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Starting classes grant template abilities to guide later progression, and allow the players to use archetypes to get up and running quickly in the fantasy milieu. After character creation, their roles and abilities are defined by the equipment they carry and their experiences gained during their adventures.

### Death
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

### Fiction First
Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.

### Growth
Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

### Player Choice
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

### Principles
The Overseer and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Overseers
### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty
- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

### Preparation
- The game world is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and makes sharp turns.
- Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories or plots.
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world.
- NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.

### Narrative Focus
- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

### Danger
- The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

### Treasure
- A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story.
- Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige.
- Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting.
- Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

### Choice
- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.

### Die of Fate
- Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, unique character knowledge, etc.).
- In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors the players.
- A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their allies.

## Principles for Players
### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the Warden's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

### Planning
- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

### Ambition
- Set goals and use your meager means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

## Character Creation

#### Name, Background & Traits
First, choose or roll your PC’s **name** and **background** from their respective [tables](#name--background-d20). A PC’s background informs their potential knowledge and skills.

Next, roll for the rest of your character's **traits** (appearance, speech, mannerisms, beliefs, reputation, etc.) on the [**Character Traits**](#character-traits-d10) tables.

Finally, roll for their **age** (2d20+10).

#### Ability Scores
Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:  
**Blood (BLD)**, **Sight (SGT)**, and **Grit (GRT)**. When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

<details markdown="block">
  <summary>
Expand For Example
 </summary>
 Ines rolls for her character's **BLD**, resulting in a **2**, a **4**, and a **6**, totaling **12**. The next two ability rolls result in a **9** for **SGT** and a **13** for **GRT**. She decides to swap the **12** and the **9**, for a character with **9 BLD**, **12 SGT** and **13** **GRT**.
</details>

### Hit Protection
Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Breath** (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. Breath does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing**). If an attack takes a PC's Breath exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [**Scars**](#scars-1) table.

#### Inventory
Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such as the belt, chest, or head). The backpack can also double as an emergency sleeping bag but only if emptied of its contents.

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Overseer's discretion.

**Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment.

#### Starting Gear
All PCs begin with:

- Three days' rations (one slot)
- A torch (one slot)
- 3d6 gold pieces

Choose a [**Starting Class**](#starting-classes). This represents your character's profession and training at the start of their career. This does not limit them in any way from learning something or utilizing any item.

See the **Equipment List** for related armor, damage, and slot values. Smaller items can sometimes be bundled together into one slot.

## Rules
### Abilities
Each of the three **abilities** are used in different circumstances (see **saves**, below).

**Blood (BLD)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

**Sight (SGT)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

**Grit (GRT)**: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.

### Saves
A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If they roll equal to or under that ability score, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

<details markdown="block">
  <summary>
Expand For Example
 </summary>
 _Bea encounters a group of heavily-armed Goblins standing guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course, recognizing that her 13 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best option. She rolls a d20, and resulting in a 10 – a success!_
</details>

### Healing
Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but leaves the party exposed. Ability loss (see **Critical Damage**) can usually be restored with a week's rest facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise. Some of these services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

### Deprivation & Fatigue
A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover HP or ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full night's rest in a safe spot). PCs can also gain Fatigue by **casting spells** or through events in the fiction.

### Armor
Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.  
No one can have more than 3 Armor.  
Shields, gauntlets, and helms may provide additional benefits according to their use.

### Reactions
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

| | | | | |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :--: |
|    2    | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 | 12      |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

### Morale
Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.

### Hirelings
PCs can hire **hirelings** to aid them in their expeditions. To create a hireling, roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 HP and a simple weapon (d6), then roll on the [**Character Creation**](#character-creation) tables to further flesh them out. Hirelings cost between 1-3sp per day, or a share of whatever treasure the party obtains.

### Wealth & Treasure
The most common coin is the silver mark (sp). This is equivalent to 5 copper bits (cp). Wealth and bookkeeping is often done in gold sovereigns (gp), but actual coins of gold are rare. More common are items such as jewelry, craftwork such as vases and candlesticks, and other items made of precious metals. Many folk across the world also deal in hacksilver; literally pieces of valuable items hacked into bits.

Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

Villages, strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.

## Magic
**Spellbooks** contain a single spell and take up one slot. They cannot be transcribed or created; instead they are recovered from places like tombs, dungeons, and manors.

Spellbooks sometimes display unusual properties or limitations, such as producing a foul or unearthly smell when opened, possessing an innate intelligence, or being legible only when held in moonlight.

Spellbooks will attract the attention of those who seek the arcane power within, and it is considered dangerous to display them openly.

**Scrolls** are similar to Spellbooks, however:
- They do not take up an inventory slot.
- They do not cause fatigue.
- They disappear after one use.

### Casting Spells
Anyone can cast a spell by holding a Spellbook in both hands and reading its contents aloud. They must then add a Fatigue to inventory, occupying one slot. Given time and safety, PCs can _enhance_ a spell's impact (e.g., affecting multiple targets, increasing its power, etc.) without any additional cost. If the PC is deprived or in danger, the Warden may require a PC to make a WIL save to avoid any ill-effects from casting the spell. Consequences of failure are on par with the intended effect, and may result in added Fatigue, the destruction of the Spellbook, injury, and even death.

### Relics
**Relics** are items imbued with a magical spell or power. They do not cause Fatigue. Relics usually have a limited use, as well as a recharge condition. A few examples:

**Honeyclasp** , 3 charges. A rusted ring that shrinks the bearer to 6" tall. Recharge: place in a thimble-sized cup of royal jelly.

**Falconer's Friend** , 1 charge. A bolt-shaped wand carrying the _Haste_ spell. Recharge: fire from a crossbow and recover.

**Staff of Silence** , 1 charge. This blackened rod temporarily disables all magic within 50ft. Recharge: bathe in the light of a full moon.

**Leycap** , 1 use. Anyone ingesting this green-flecked mushroom loses a Fatigue, but is then required to make a WIL save to avoid its addictive properties. A fail leaves the PC deprived and unable to focus until they can eat another leycap, providing only a brief reprieve from the addiction.

## Combat

### Rounds
The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when something occurs. A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and is comprised of turns.

### The Battlefield
Combat in **Breath & Blood** is divided into _zones_. Each zone represents an abstracted portion of the surrounding environment. Zones may be separated by distance, by barriers, or by other means. Generally speaking, anyone inside a zone can make a melee attack anyone else inside that zone. A ranged weapon can shoot accurately from one zone away, and some spells may be effective from two zones away. Generally speaking, anyone farther away than two zones is effectively outside of that engagement.

Some intense, close-quarters skirmishes may only have one zone. Other, more open areas might have three or four in various configurations.

### Setting the Scene: Tactical Action Combat
In **Breath & Blood**, each combat round is built from declared actions, but nothing actually resolves until actions are declared by all participants. Think of it like directing a combat scene in a film. You want to set up all the pieces and have everything placed before you call "action!" and have the camera rolling. Because of this, slower actors will actually _declare_ their actions first. Those who react faster will have the chance to try and interrupt actions by attacking, maneuvering, or otherwise altering the situation before time rolls forward and the actions resolve in order.

### Fast and Slow Actions
Action declaration is divided into three phases: Fast PCs, NPCs, and Slow PCs. Slow PCs will declare their actions first. NPCs declare their actions next, and finally fast PCs may take what action they deem necessary to change the landscape of the battle.

### Combat Begins
All PCs involved in the combat roll a Sight saving throw. Any character who succeeds may act in the Fast PCs phase. All who fail must declare their actions in the Slow PC phase.

### Actions and Action Order
On their turn, a character may take one action. This may be casting a spell, attacking, making a second move, or some other reasonable action. Moving one zone is an action, as is making any kind of attack.

Each round, the PCs declare what action they are taking. As actions are declared, the Overseer will build a list, starting at the bottom and ending at the top. If there is a conflict to determine whose action will go first, compare their SGT scores. A higher SGT score will go higher in the order than a lower one. If a character attempts something risky, the Warden calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs.

  </summary>
  _Leo and Brock are fighting a wyvern hatchling at the edge of a cliff. Leo fails his SGT saving throw and must declare in the Slow PC phase. Brock's SGT save was a success, and he declares in the Fast PC Phase. Leo declares first: he is going to close in and attack the wyvern. The wyvern declares next: it is going to sting Leo with its tail, and then immediately take flight. Brock, a Fighter, decides that he will try to use his ability called **Any Means Necessary** to interrupt the wyvern's attack and knock it back down to the ground. With all actions declared, the Action Order is now: Brock - **Any Means Necessary**, Wyvern - Sting and Fly, Leo - Close and Attack. If Brock is successful using his ability, the wyvern won't be able to move, allowing Leo to get his attack in before the creature takes flight._
</details>

### Attacking & Damage
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP. Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

Expand For Example
 </summary>
 _The Wood Troll roars, swinging its club at Bea, who has 5 HP. The club does 1d10 damage and the Warden rolls a 4. They subtract 1 to account for Bea's  leather armor, leaving Bea with 2 HP remaining._
</details>

### Shields Shall Splinter
A character wielding a shield in combat may decide to sacrifice that shield in order to entirely negate a single incoming attack. The shield is ruined, and must be discarded.

### Multiple Attackers
If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

### Attack Modifiers
If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is **impaired** and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage regardless of the attacks damage die.

If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is **enhanced**, allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.

### Dual Weapons
If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.

### Blast
Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted battlefield zone(s), rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

### Critical Damage
Damage that reduces a target's HP below zero decreases a target's STR by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage**. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.

Any PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize, but gain 1 Fatigue. If left untreated, they die within the hour.

### Ability Score Loss
If a PC's BLD is reduced to 0, they die. If their SGT is reduced to 0, they are effectively blinded and unable to make sense of their surroundings. If their GRT is reduced to 0, they are panicked, exhausted or simply unable to go on.
Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.

### Scars
When damage to a PC reduces their HP to exactly 0, they are sometimes changed irrevocably. See the [**Scars**](/cairn-srd#scars-1) table for more.

### Unconsciousness & Death
When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of a hireling. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

### Detachments
Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are **impaired** (excluding blast damage).  
Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal blast damage.

### Retreat
Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful SGT save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Scars
When an attack reduces a PC's HP to exactly 0, they are uniquely impacted. Look up the result on the table below based on the _total_ damage taken:

|      |                                                              |
|------ |---|
| 1    | Lasting Scar: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1: Neck, 2: Hands, 3: Eye, 4: Chest, 5: Legs, 6: Ear. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 2    | Rattling Blow: You’re disoriented and shaken. Describe how you refocus. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 3    | Walloped: You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. You are deprived until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max HP. |
| 4    | Broken Limb: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1-2: Leg, 3-4: Arm, 5: Rib, 6: Skull. Once mended, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 5    | Diseased: You’re afflicted with a gross, uncomfortable infection. When you get over it, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 6    | Reorienting Head Wound: Roll 1d6 &#124; 1-2: STR, 3-4: DEX, 5-6: WIL. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current ability score, take the new result. |
| 7    | Hamstrung: You can barely move until you get serious help and rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max DEX, take the new result. |
| 8    | Deafened: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d4. |
| 9    | Re-brained: Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result. |
| 10   | Sundered: An appendage is torn off, crippled or useless. The Warden will tell you which. Then, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d6. |
| 11   | Mortal Wound: You are deprived and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP. |
| 12   | Doomed: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |

## Exploration - Dungeons

Exploration of tight, ruined, protected or otherwise dangerous locations is a core part of the "adventuring" experience. Whether these are mythical underground dungeons that shift and change, tombs of ancient kings, or the forlorn ruins of forgotten civilizations, it's hard to deny that "dungeons" are one of the most common ways to begin a new adventure.

Below are some ideas about how to tackle the exploration of these "dungeon" spaces in Breath & Blood.

### What Is A Dungeon, Anyway?

Any location which has points of interest which require careful exploration, where movement is constricted to predetermined paths, and where tricks, treasure and threats abound can be called a dungeon. This doesn't have to be a below-ground structure dedicated to the imprisonment of unfortunate individuals. A ruined keep at the edge of civilization, a sunken temple to a fallen god or a burial chamber are all examples. A living bandit fort crawling with guards might also be played out like a dungeon. The "dungeon" takes many forms, but all of them share these certain elements:

- Restricted Movement
- Slow Exploration
- Threat Lurks Around Every Corner

Once you have these elements in place, you can play it as a dungeon.

### Dungeon Design

There are many treatises on good dungeon design, and you are encouraged to read them. For the purposes of Breath & Blood, you can consider dungeon design largely in two categories.

The first is the traditional dungeon map. This is a map drawn on graph paper, with each location marked and keyed with some description. Whether it is populated ahead of time by the Overseer, or on the fly with dice rolls and random tables, this represents the layout of an actual physical location in the game world.

The second possibility is a dungeon diagram. Instead of an architectural blueprint, the dungeon diagram instead looks more like a flow chart. Points of interest are marked, and abstract lines representing connections between them show the paths that can be taken. While this method sacrifices some grounded realism, it can make for a far easier time for those who want to randomize a dungeon on the fly, or for those who don't feel that the artistic pursuit of dungeon mapping is for them. The diagram also obviously represents a real space, but instead of specific measurements and layouts, it shows the flow of progression.

Either method is supported by the dungeon exploration rules of Breath & Blood.

### Exploring a Dungeon

#### Dungeon Turns

A **dungeon turn** represents approximately ten minutes of game time. While exploring a dungeon, the entire group of adventurers moves as a unit called "the party". During this time they might be investigating a point of interest, moving through corridors, having discussions with NPCs, fighting a battle with something dangerous, trying to disarm a trap, or similar activities. In general, most kinds of activity will use up one dungeon turn.

If you are using a traditional dungeon map, consider that the PCs can carefully move about 100 feet during a turn. This includes them moving carefully through dimly-lit spaces, watching carefully for traps or dangers, stepping over rubble or around collapsed walls, and generally taking their time and being careful. If they are throwing caution to the wind, they might move as much as 200 feet in a turn, BUT this may require a SGT save to avoid blundering into danger.

For each dungeon turn that passes, the Overseer should roll the **Encounter Die** (see below). 

#### Encounter Die

For each dungeon turn that passes, roll 1d6.

| Result | Effect |
| ------- | -------- |
| 1 | a random encounter |
| 2 | signs of passage - someone or something else nearby |
| 3 | stress - rest (and roll again), add 1 Fatigue or consume a ration  |
| 4 | light decrement - spend 1 additional use of a torch |
| 5 | material change in the local environment |
| 6 | nothing happens |

#### Light

Light is cast by torches, lanterns and by some magic spells. This allows the party to see approximately 20 feet in every direction, if using a traditional dungeon map. For a dungeon diagram, it can be assumed that the torch provides enough light to carefully explore the points of interest and their connections, as long as the party is moving cautiously. 

Under standard Breath & Blood rules, when exploring the dungeon, the _light decrement_ result on the Encounter Die means that a torch degrades or a magic spell fizzles out. The torch must be re-lit (expending another use) or the magic spell must be re-cast.

If you prefer somewhat more realism in your light sources, you can track the number of turns that has passed. Under these alternate rules, a torch lasts for 6 turns and a magical spell lasts for 10 turns. Replace a 3 on the Encounter Die chart with another "nothing happens" and simply ignore this result when it comes up.

#### Dread

Exploring tight, dark and claustrophic spaces can be difficult for the psyche of even the most hardened adventurer. When the PCs confront a particularly terrifying situation (they are surrounded, trapped in a room with no obvious exits, run out of light, enter a very tightly enclosed space, etc) they must resist the creeping onset of Dread. Each PC in the situation should roll a GRT save. On a failure, they suffer 1 Fatigue. For each dungeon turn that this situation persists, they must make an additional GRT save.

## Bestiary

**Ratling**  
2 HP, 6 STR, 14 DEX, 8 WIL, sharp stick (d6)
- Bargain, wheedle, plead and lie until they have a decisive advantage.
- Hoards stolen shiny goods in claustrophobic underground warrens.
- Critical Damage: Attempts to grab and haul away any creature that suffers critical damage in a combat.

**Risen Dead (Detachment)**  
12 HP, 11 STR, 5 DEX, 5 WIL, stiff arms and bony fingers (d6)
- Bloated, decrepit or rotten corpses of the unquiet dead.
- Comes in swarms of slow, mindless advancing menace. Always declares actions first.

**Spectre**  
10 HP, 1 Armor, 10 STR, 15 DEX, 10 WIL, spectral hand (d8)
- Vaguely-shaped forms of arctic-cold mist with grasping hands.
- Immune to normal damage; can only be harmed by magic or magical weapons.
- Critical damage: Spirit Drain (lose 1d6 GRT)

**Wyvern**   
15 HP, 15 STR, 12 DEX, 7 WIL, claws and bite (d8+d6 blast), poison tail (d8)
- A gray-scaled dragon the size of a packhorse, with a vicious barb on the end of its long whiplike tail.
- Strikes from above with its long tail to poison its enemies.
- Poison tail causes total paralysis, requires GRT save to resist

**Wild Elf**
8 HP, 1 Armor, 8 STR, 15 DEX, 12 WIL, elegant hunting bow (d8) or serrated blade (d8), a Spellbook (Choose one: _Sleep_, _Charm_, _Displace_)
- Cloaked in furs and ragged cloth, masters of moving through woodlands undetected.
- Strikes from the shadows by surprise, ambush with arrows and alpha strike with blades.

**Animated Armor Stand**  
4 HP, Armor 2, 10 STR, 8 DEX, 2 WIL
- Rusted armor comes to life wielding ancient weapons attached to wooden frames.
- Clusters in on a single target, acting as one mind.

### Creating Monsters
Use the following template to model any more sophisticated Monster or NPC:

**Name**  
X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Weapon (dX, special items, qualities)
- Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor
- Quirk, tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique
- Special effect or critical damage consequence

**General Principles**  
Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.
- Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardy ones 6 HP, and serious threats get 10+ HP.
- Use flavor and style to help them stand out. Players will remember a pig-faced humanoid looking for his missing sheep more easily than a generic goblin archer.
- Use critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.
- Remember that Breath is not Hit Points. It's a measure of resilience, luck, and gumption - not health.

**Converting from OSR Games**
- Give 1 HP per HD for most creatures.
- Most humanoids have at least 4HP.
- **Morale** can also be used as a baseline.

Some pointers:
- Is it good at avoiding a hit? Give it HP.
- Does it soak up damage? Give it Armor.
- Is it strong? Give it a high **STR**.
- Is it nimble? Give it high **DEX**.
- Is it charismatic? Give it high **WIL**.

Damage die are roughly the same, though armed attacks do at least 1d6 damage.

# Rules Summary

**ACTIONS**  
On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. Actions may include casting a spell, attacking, making a second move, or other reasonable activities. Actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously. Whenever turn order is uncertain, the PCs should make a DEX save to see if they go before their enemies.

**Retreating** from a dangerous situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

**ABILITIES**  
**STR:** Brawn, prowess & resistance.   
**DEX:** Dodging, sneaking & reflexes.   
**WIL:** Persuasion, intimidation & magic.

**SAVES**
- Roll a d20 equal to or under an ability.
- 1 is always a success, 20 is always a failure.

**HIT PROTECTION**  
**HP** indicates a PC's ability to avoid getting hurt. It is lost during combat & recovered after a few moment's rest.

**INVENTORY**  
PCs have 10 inventory slots: four on their body and six in their backpack (which acts as a sleeping bag if emptied). Most items take up a one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.

Filling all ten item slots reduces a PC to 0 HP. PCs cannot carry more than their inventory allows, though carts & horses may provide an increase in slots.

**DEPRIVATION**  
**Deprived** PCs cannot recover HP. If deprived for more than a day,they add a **Fatigue** to inventory. Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they can recover in safety. This effect is cumulative.

**HEALING**  
A moment's rest and a swig of water will restore lost HP, but may leave the party vulnerable. **Ability** loss requires a week's rest and the aid of a skilled healer.

**SPELLBOOKS**  
Spellbooks contain a single spell and take up one item slot. Anyone can cast a spell by holding a Spellbook in both hands and reading its contents aloud. Casting a spell adds **Fatigue** to the PC's inventory.

Given time and safety, PCs can enhance a spell without any additional cost. If they are deprived or in danger, a WIL save may be required to avoid terrible consequences.

**COMBAT**  
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's Armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP.

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No one can have more than 3 Armor.

**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 damage. If **multiple attackers** target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. If attacking with **two weapons** at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the highest.

If an attack is **impaired** , the damage die is reduced to 1d4, regardless of weapon. If the attack is **enhanced**, the attacker rolls 1d12. Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all area targets, rolling separately for each.

**DAMAGE**  
If an attack reduces a PC’s HP exactly to 0, refer to the [**Scars**](/cairn-srd#scars-1) table.
 
Damage that reduces a target's HP **below** 0 decreases their STR by the remainder. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage.** Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means **death;** having DEX 0 is paralysis; having WIL 0 is delirium.
