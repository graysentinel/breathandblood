Breath & Blood is an [adventure game](http://questingblog.com/adventure-game-vs-osr) about reluctant adventurers making a hard living on the edges of civilization in a dark fantasy world. Character generation is quick and random, mostly-classless, and relies on fictional advancement rather than through XP or level mechanics. It is based on [Cairn](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn), [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave) by Ben Milton and [Into The Odd](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/electric-bastionland) by Chris McDowall. The game was written by [Tumbledie Games](https://www.tumbledie.com).
